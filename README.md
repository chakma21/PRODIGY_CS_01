Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 1: Caesar Cipher Program
Task Description:
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech for the month of June, I was tasked with creating a program that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption method. 
The Caesar Cipher is a basic cryptographic technique used in cybersecurity, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet based on a user-provided key.

Program Functionality:
The program I developed in Python performs the following functions:

User Input:
The program prompts the user to input a message that they want to either encrypt or decrypt.

Action Selection:
The user is then asked to choose whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the provided message.

Key Input:
The program asks for a numerical key which will be used to perform the encryption or decryption. The key determines the number of positions each character in the message will be shifted.

Processing and Output:
Based on the user's choice and the provided key, the program processes the message to either encrypt or decrypt it and then displays the result.

Continuation Prompt:
After processing the message, the program prompts the user to decide if they want to end the process, continue with the same message, or start with a new message.

This program provides a simple yet effective implementation of the Caesar Cipher, demonstrating the basic principles of encryption and decryption in a user-friendly manner.
